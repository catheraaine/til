# Today I Learned
### What is this thing, Cat?

TIL is a gathering of quick descriptions of things that, well, that I learned. Today.

[Check out a nifty list of posts, here.](contents.md)


### But why?

Fellow apprentice, @BC3209, started doing this, and he is a smart guy. So I decided to do it, too. Because emulating smart people is how we become smarter ourselves. I think Bennett gives credit to @jbranchaud. So lots of smart folks do this thing.

I hope to accomplish two things:

1. Challenge myself to learn at least one new thing [nearly] every day, and,

2. Create a physical archive of my growth as a developer, employee, and human in general.

I cannot promise everything will be code related. Or that any of it will be life changing. But I do hope to recognize my progress going forward.


Wish me luck!
