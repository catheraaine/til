# Today I Learned
### What is this thing, Cat?

TIL is a repo of md files that describe small snippets of things that, well, that I learned. Today.

Fellow apprentice, @BC3209, started doing this, and he is a smart guy. So I decided to do it, too. Because emulating smart people is how we become smarter ourselves.

I cannot promise everything will be code related. I hope to accomplish two things:

1. Challenge myself to learn at least one new thing [nearly] every day, and,

2. Create a physical archive of my growth as a developer, employee, and human in general.

Wish me luck!
